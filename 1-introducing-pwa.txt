CLASS 1: 

        What are PWA?

            build for all devices from one code base
            use languages of the web (WA)
            real device specific app not just website.

        How do PWAs compare to device specific apps?
            - device specific languages VS html,css,js
            - compiled & packged as executable VS hosted on web servers
            - one code base per device VS single code base
            - one executable per device VS a single hosted app
            - installed VS installed, and accessible via a URL or search engine (discovered and included in search engine results pages - SERPs - can be index by search engines - search engines can crawl pwa's content)
            - can be distributed in application stores VS can be distributed in application stores

        How do PWAs compare to websites?
            - almost like websites
                - use same technologies
                - linkable (linkability)
                - discoverable by search engines (discoverability)
                - safe to use on browser (Secure)
                - (Responsiveness)
            - and more than that
                - can be installed (Installability)
                    - it has its own icon - in start menu, taskbar
                    - it has its own standalone window like traditional app
                    - access to much more advanced capabilities
                - I can get push notification alerts even if PWA is not actively in use (Re-Engageibility)
                - I can get a offline PWA experience (Network Independence)
                - 
            

        What capabilities do PWAs have access to?
            - offline access 
                - only at initial is internet access needed.
                - it can cached information.
                - it can use local storage.
                - it can even download things like movies, article for offline viewing & on

            - native sharing 
                - notice you can share pictures in your photo album with other application.
                - you hit the share button & the devices shows you other native application you can share to.
                - PWAs have this functionality also, it can share content & received shared content


        Can PWAs really do as much as native apps like low level hardware stuff & complicated computing?
            - the web has been in constant evolution over the years.
            - the gap btw what the web can do & what native apps can do have been closing more & more.
            - one technique is called Web Assembly (WASM)
                - allows run native modules e.g c++ code that can manipulate movies, songs or whatever 
                - & you can compile this down to modules with web assembly to run on websites & PWAs 
                - & it will run at speed that is near native
            another technique is Low-Level Hardware Access
                - PWAs have APIs to talk over bluetooth or USB or NFC


        How to Create a PWA?
            - you need three layers on knowledge to create your own PWAs
            - the first layer
                - at this layer are three technologies
                - HTML, CSS, JS for the user interface of the app
            - the second layer
                - at this layer are three technologies
                - MANIFEST, SW(service workers) & HTTPS
                - Manifest is a json file which will contain the icon, name, description of the app & other information about how your app will integrate into the operating system  
                - SW is a bit complicated. the file is in charge of making your app reliable. it takes care of requesting, fetching, offline support e.t.c
                - HTTPS provide secure connection to the webserver
            - the third layer
                - at this layer we deal with DEVICE ADAPTATION, OS INTEGRATION & OFFLINE SUPPORT

        Can PWAs be distributed in app stores?
            - a pwa is a website at its core so you cant publish a website directly in app stores.
            - BUT you can use a tool called PWA BUILDER.COM
            - with this tool you can scan the url of your progressive web app & it will give you some warnings to take care of & if everything is fine it will give you a package or multiple packages which you can host all stores like ios store, android store, microsoft store
