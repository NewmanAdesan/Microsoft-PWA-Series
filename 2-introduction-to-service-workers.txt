CLASS 2 : Introduction to Service workers

    What is a service worker?
        - javscript file (sw.js) added to your application
        - responsible for making app reliable 
        - to load service worker, utilize navigator.serviceWorker.register(sw.js) in index.html
        - run in separate thread from your website
        - responsible for making app offline capable
        - responsible for intercepting, modifying & responding to network request utilizing 2 api's 'THE FETCH API' and 'THE CACHE API'
        - it is network reliable because of this two api's, knows when to fetch from the network & when to cache the data 


    How to make an app work offline
        - in service worker make sure to download enough infomation in the cache so your application can display something.
        - typically download the html, css & js needed offline & place in cache using 'THE CACHE API' (caching the static resource your application needs)
        - then other dynamic content that you want displayed offline can be stored in the cache also or index.db, 
        - the SW can detect the offline status & get the content from the index.db


    How to get Started with Service Worker
        - SW are the brain behind the app & contain a lot of comple logic SO one step at a time.
        - start with simple caching logic (Cache static resources)
        - then handle a custom offline page ()
        - then more complicated 
        - don't do it alone. tons of resources to bulid a service worker

            - the workbox library (makes the service worker code simpler & no need to worry about the complexity)


    Can Service Workers do other things
        - three other things are
        - push messages
        - offline listening
        - periodic updates

        - push messages
        - this is a great way to re-engage users with the app

        - offline listening
        - SW runs separately from the app, it keeps listening
        - if your server sends a message to your device, even though your app is not open the SW listens & can get the message & cache them & even show like a notification on the screen

        - periodic update
        - for example you can set up the SW so that it fetch new data from the server once a day. so when users opens the app they get fresh content.
